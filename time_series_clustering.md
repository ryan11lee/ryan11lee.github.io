## Exploration of Dynamic Time Warping for Time Series Clustering

### Description

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a method for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences which may vary in speed. It is a powerful tool for time series clustering, and is often used in the fields of data mining, pattern recognition, and machine learning. This project explores the use of DTW for time series clustering, and assess its performance on [Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephengoldie/big-databiopharmaceutical-manufacturing), "Big Data Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing" dataset.

### Data

The data provided by Kaggle is a collection of time series data from a biopharmaceutical manufacturing process. The data consists of 100 batches. The data is provided in a CSV file, with each row representing a single observation, and each column representing a single time series. The data is provided in a "wide" format, with each time series in a separate column. The data is also provided in a "long" format, with each observation in a separate row. The data is provided in both formats to allow for easy use with different software packages.

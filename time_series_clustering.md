## Exploration of Dynamic Time Warping for Time Series Clustering

### Description

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a method for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences which may vary in speed. It is a powerful tool for time series clustering, and is often used in the fields of data mining, pattern recognition, and machine learning. This project explores the use of DTW for time series clustering, and assess its performance on [Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephengoldie/big-databiopharmaceutical-manufacturing), "Big Data Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing" dataset.

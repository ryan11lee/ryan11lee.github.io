**Project description:** Utilizing data from Kaggle, I to create an anomaly detection model that allows for fermentation process. Because fermentation data is a time series, with specific trends having "spikes" as part of a good run, a lot automated tooling will detect errors, when they are actually normal behaviors. The apporach i took was that since there is training data for "good" runs, we will build an autoencoder, whrre the reconstruction will be compared to the original trend. Any difference between actual and predicted will be summarized as error. Thus with enough runs, we can determine a mean for the population and see which runs are statistically an outlier.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

Control logic during fermentation is difficult to discern when a run is deviating vs being controlled correctly so build a model that can be fit to understand the normal trends vs deviations. 


```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
